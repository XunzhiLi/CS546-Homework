                My family went to Japan for travelling on the vacation after i
                graduated from high school.It was a very hot June but i can
                still remeber the smell of rains ,because it rained all days.

                Compared to China, Japan was actually not prosperous in cities
                but surprisingly in order.There were many people on the street,
                but the roads were complete clean.All vehicles would actively
                avoid pedestrians, whether there were red or green. I traveled
                from Nara to Kyoto ,and then Osaka,finally Tokyo.All Japanese i
                met were so friendly and polite.As a Chinese,i knew all the
                culture of Japan came from China. But i still got shocked due to
                these and i think travelling in Japan brought a different
                felling.

                By the way,Japanese food is also so delicious.Compared to
                Chinese food,Japanese food is completed oil-negative which
                should be the reason why Japan has almost no Obesity.
